# Feature: Initial Setup

## User Stories

### US-001: Basic Archive Functionality
**As a** developer using spec-kit  
**I want to** archive completed feature specifications  
**So that** I can maintain a clean working directory while preserving historical specs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Feature specs are moved from `specs/NNN-feature/` to `specs/archive/NNN-feature/`
- Spec files are merged into `specs/latest/` using intelligent strategies
- Original feature directory is preserved in archive
- Process is reversible (can inspect archived specs)

**Priority**: P1

### US-002: Intelligent Merge Strategies
**As a** spec maintainer  
**I want** different sections to use appropriate merge strategies  
**So that** information is accumulated or overwritten based on semantic meaning

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User stories are accumulated (all preserved)
- Requirements (FR-XXX) are merged by ID (latest wins)
- Success criteria are accumulated with uniqueness check
- Technical context is accumulated for historical record

**Priority**: P1

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Archive Command
The system shall provide a command-line tool `archive-feature.sh` that:
- Accepts `--feature <slug>` parameter
- Validates feature directory exists
- Moves feature to archive location
- Merges relevant files to `specs/latest/`

### FR-002: Merge Strategies
The system shall implement constitution-driven merge strategies:
- **Accumulate**: Combine both contents (user stories, technical context)
- **Merge by ID**: ID-based merging with latest precedence (FR-XXX, NFR-XXX)
- **Accumulate Unique**: Remove duplicates while accumulating (success criteria)
- **Latest**: Use incoming version only (summary sections)

### FR-003: Validation
The system shall validate implementation alignment:
- Check if P1 user stories have corresponding tests
- Verify files mentioned in plan.md exist
- Confirm entities in data-model.md exist in code
- Report warnings (non-blocking)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
Archive operations shall complete within 10 seconds for typical features (< 500 lines of specs).

### NFR-002: Reliability
All operations shall be atomic. On failure, the system shall rollback changes and report clear error messages.

### NFR-003: Compatibility
The system shall work on:
- macOS (Bash 4.0+)
- Linux (Bash 4.0+)
- Git repositories (optional)

## Success Criteria

### SC-001: Zero Information Loss
After archiving multiple features, all user stories, requirements, and success criteria from all features are present in `specs/latest/spec.md`.

### SC-002: Merge Correctness
Requirements with the same ID are merged correctly, with the latest version taking precedence while preserving unique content.

### SC-003: Usability
Developers can archive a feature with a single command without manual file manipulation.

## Dependencies
- Git (for repository detection)
- Bash 4.0+
- AWK (for Markdown parsing)

## Risks
- **Merge conflicts**: If specs have incompatible structures, merge may fail
  - *Mitigation*: Clear error messages, manual merge fallback
- **Data loss**: Bug in merge logic could lose information
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, archive preservation, git history
