# 🧭 Guidelines
# - Keep commits at a "human-reviewable" granularity
# - Never push directly to branches, even for AI-generated changes
# - All changes must go through review and verification process
# - Specify appropriate type for tests, docs, and config changes
#
# 🧠 Examples:
#   feat(archive): add intelligent merge for data-model entities
#   fix(core): resolve section parsing issue with nested headings
#   chore(config): update merge-rules.json template
#
# 🔐 Operational Rules
# - Use "AI:" prefix for AI-generated commits
#   Example: AI: feat(docs): auto-generate usage examples
# - Do not merge/push to main branch until human review is complete
# - Security-related changes must be reviewed and approved
# - Follow Conventional Commits format even for auto-generated commits
