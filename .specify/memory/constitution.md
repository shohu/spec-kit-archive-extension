# Spec-Kit Archive Extension Constitution

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Zero Information Loss
All user stories, requirements, and success criteria must be preserved during archiving and merging. No specification content should be lost or overwritten unintentionally.

**Rationale**: Specifications represent the cumulative knowledge and decisions of the project. Losing this information breaks the spec-driven development workflow.

### Principle 2: Constitution-Driven Merge Strategies
Merge strategies must be driven by the project's constitution and the semantic meaning of each section, not by arbitrary rules.

**Rationale**: Different types of content require different merge strategies. User stories accumulate, requirements merge by ID, technical context preserves history.

### Principle 3: Implementation Validation
Archived specifications must reflect actual implementation. Tests, files, and entities mentioned in specs must exist in code.

**Rationale**: Specs that don't match implementation are misleading and reduce trust in the specification system.

### Principle 4: Portability and Self-Containment
The extension must work as a self-contained system that can be installed in any spec-kit project without dependencies on external services.

**Rationale**: Projects need reliable, portable tools that don't require complex setup or external dependencies.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Archive operations should complete within 10 seconds for typical features (< 500 lines of specs)
- Merge algorithms must handle large spec files (> 10,000 lines) without significant slowdown

### Reliability
- All archive operations must be atomic (rollback on failure)
- Merge conflicts must be detected and reported, never silently ignored
- Validation failures are informational only, never block archiving

### Compatibility
- Bash 4.0+ (widely available on macOS and Linux)
- Git integration is optional, works with or without Git workflows
- Multiple constitution support (future: allow per-feature constitutions)

## Scope

### In Scope
- Archiving completed features from `specs/NNN-feature/` to `specs/archive/`
- Intelligent merging into `specs/latest/` using constitution-driven strategies
- Implementation validation (tests, files, entities)
- Git branch integration (optional)
- JSON output for scripting
- AI prompt templates (Cursor, Codex)

### Out of Scope
- Real-time spec editing or collaborative editing
- Web-based UI (command-line and AI-driven only)
- Automatic conflict resolution (humans decide)
- Spec versioning beyond archive (Git handles this)
- Multi-repository spec synchronization

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Shellcheck compliance (no warnings)
- POSIX-compatible where possible, Bash 4.0+ for advanced features
- Clear error messages with actionable suggestions
- Comprehensive inline documentation

### Testing
- Manual testing on real projects (dogfooding)
- Examples in `examples/` directory
- Documentation includes runnable examples
- AI prompts tested with Cursor and Codex

### Documentation
- README.md: Quick start and overview
- docs/usage.md: Detailed usage patterns
- docs/architecture.md: Technical design decisions
- docs/constitution-guide.md: How to write a good constitution
- Inline help (`--help` flag)

## Change Management

### Constitution Updates
- Rare (only for fundamental principle changes)
- Requires discussion and consensus
- Versioned (track changes in git history)

### Merge Strategy Updates
- config/merge-rules.json allows customization
- Default strategies codified in merge-spec.sh
- Community feedback influences defaults

### Breaking Changes
- Avoided when possible
- Clearly documented in CHANGELOG
- Migration guides provided
- Deprecation warnings before removal
