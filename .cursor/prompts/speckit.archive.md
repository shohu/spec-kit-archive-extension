## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

**Note**: The feature slug is **optional**. If the user provides an empty command (no arguments), you MUST auto-detect the most recent feature directory. Do not ask the user to provide it unless auto-detection fails.

## Cursor IDE Execution Strategy

**Multi-model support**: This prompt works with Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5, or other selected models.

**Parallel tool execution**: Leverage Cursor's ability to call multiple tools simultaneously for validation and file reads.

**IDE-integrated workflow**: Use specialized file tools (`read_file`, `list_dir`, `grep`) for better integration.

**Error recovery**: If bash scripts fail, fall back to manual parsing using file tools.

**Context retention**: Maintain all validation results and warnings across execution steps.

**Recommended models**:
- **GPT-5**: Best for complex validation and autonomous merge decisions
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Excellent for parallel processing and detailed analysis

## Outline

1. **Determine feature slug** (auto-detection if not provided)
   - Start in repo root: `repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
   - Parse user input: `feature_slug=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | xargs | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//')`
   - **If empty or $ARGUMENTS is literally "$ARGUMENTS"**, auto-detect the most recent feature:
     ```bash
     feature_slug=$(cd "$repo_root/specs" && ls -1d [0-9][0-9][0-9]-* 2>/dev/null | \
       grep -v '^latest$' | grep -v '^archive$' | sort -r | head -n1)
     ```
   - If still no slug found ‚Üí Use `list_dir` tool to enumerate `specs/` and ERROR "No feature directories found"
   - Output for confirmation: "üì¶ Archiving feature: **{feature_slug}**"

2. **Resolve and validate paths** (use parallel reads where possible)
   - Feature directory: `$repo_root/specs/$feature_slug`
   - If directory missing ‚Üí ERROR "Feature directory not found"
   - **Parallel validation**: Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` simultaneously to check completeness

3. **Pre-flight checks (informational)**
   - **Tasks check**: Load `tasks.md` (if present) and detect any unchecked items `[ ]`
     - Use `read_file` tool for reliable parsing
     - If items remain, warn user but continue (archiving may proceed if intentional)
   - **Implementation validation**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/archive/core/validate-implementation.sh`
     - Use `run_terminal_cmd` with proper error handling
     - Checks if spec.md user stories have tests
     - Checks if plan.md mentioned files exist
     - Checks if data-model.md entities exist in code
     - Warnings are informational only, do not block archiving
   - **If validation script fails**: Fall back to manual grep-based checks

4. **Check Git branch and prompt for merge**
   - Detect current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - If on a spec branch (pattern: `feat/specs-XXX-*`):
     - Ask user: "üîÄ Archive completed. Merge into parent branch after archiving? (y/N)"
     - If yes, add `--with-merge` flag to archive command
   - If not on spec branch or user declines, proceed without merge flag

5. **Run archive script**
   - Command (bash):\
     `(cd "$repo_root" && .specify/scripts/bash/archive/core/archive-feature.sh --json --feature "$feature_slug" [--with-merge])`
   - Use `run_terminal_cmd` tool with `explanation` describing the merge operation
   - Run **exactly once** per invocation
   - **With --with-merge flag**: Script will prompt for merge confirmation and handle branch operations
   - The script performs:
     - **Intelligent merge** using constitution-driven strategies:
       - `spec.md`: Accumulates user stories, merges requirements by ID
       - `plan.md`: Accumulates technical context and risks, uses latest architecture
       - `data-model.md`: Merges entities intelligently
       - `quickstart.md`, `research.md`: Simple updates
     - **Note**: `tasks.md` is NOT synced (tasks are completed at archive time)
     - Syncs `contracts/` directory
     - Moves feature to `specs/archive/$feature_slug`
   - **Error handling**: If command fails:
     1. Capture and display stderr/stdout in full
     2. Check if partial merge occurred (inspect `specs/latest/`)
     3. Offer to retry or manual intervention steps
     - Do NOT silently fail - always surface errors to user

6. **Parse JSON output**
   - Expect keys: `archived_path`, `latest_path`, `synced_items`, `warnings`, `merge_performed` (if --with-merge used)
   - Use absolute paths
   - **If JSON parsing fails**: Fall back to reading output files directly with `read_file`

7. **Post-archive verification** (parallel reads)
   - Read merged `specs/latest/spec.md` to count user stories
   - Read merged `specs/latest/plan.md` to verify technical sections
   - Read merged `specs/latest/data-model.md` to count entities
   - List `specs/latest/contracts/` directory contents
   - **Summarize changes** with concrete numbers and file paths

8. **Summarize results**
   - Show archived location: `specs/archive/$feature_slug/`
   - List merged files in `specs/latest/`:
     - `spec.md` (user stories accumulated, requirements merged by ID)
     - `plan.md` (technical info merged)
     - `data-model.md` (entities merged)
     - `contracts/` (synced)
   - Mention validation results if any
   - Note any remaining unchecked tasks (informational)
   - **If merge was performed**: Show merge result (branch name, status)

9. **Next steps**
   - **If merged**: Branch is now on parent, ready for push
   - **If not merged**: 
     - Recommend: `git status` to review changes
     - Recommend: `git add specs/archive/ specs/latest/` to stage changes
   - Suggest: Create next feature with `/speckit.specify` or review merged specs
   - Optional: Run `/speckit.plan` for the next feature

## Response Format

Start with feature detection confirmation (if auto-detected):
```
üì¶ Auto-detected feature: <feature-slug>
```

Then show the main result:
```
‚úÖ Archived feature: <feature slug>

üì¶ Archive location:
   specs/archive/<feature-slug>/

üìù Merged to specs/latest/:
   - spec.md (N user stories, M requirements)
   - plan.md (technical context updated)
   - data-model.md (N entities)
   - contracts/ (synced)

üîç Validation:
   <validation results or "All checks passed">

‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings:
   <if any outstanding tasks or validation warnings, or "None">

üîÄ Git Integration:
   <if merge was performed: "‚úÖ Merged into <parent-branch>, branch deleted">
   <if merge was skipped: "Merge skipped, changes staged for commit">

üìå Next steps:
   <if merged>:
   1. Current branch: <parent-branch>
   2. Push: git push origin <parent-branch>
   3. Continue: /speckit.specify (for next feature)
   
   <if not merged>:
   1. Review: git status
   2. Stage: git add specs/archive/ specs/latest/
   3. Commit: git commit -m "feat: archive <feature-slug>"
   4. Continue: /speckit.specify (for next feature)
```

**Special cases**:
- If no features found: Use `list_dir` to enumerate specs/ and ask user to create one
- If multiple recent features: Show list and ask which one to archive
- If archive script fails: Report the error with stderr/stdout and suggest fixes
- If script missing: Offer to check installation or provide manual merge steps

## Cursor-Specific Best Practices

1. **Use specialized tools**: Prefer `read_file`, `list_dir`, `grep` over terminal commands for file operations
2. **Batch operations**: When reading multiple files for verification, call all `read_file` in parallel
3. **Error resilience**: If bash script fails, attempt manual parsing and merging using file tools
4. **Verbose output**: Provide detailed explanations of each merge decision
5. **Context awareness**: Reference previous validation results when summarizing
